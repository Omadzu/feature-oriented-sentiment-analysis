## Introduction
Sentiment Analysis research project.

**Goal :** Build a state-of-the-art algorithm which is capable of predicting if a review is positive, negative or neutral.

## Research papers based algoritms
### Deep learning for sentiment analysis of movie reviews

Based on this research paper, I try to understand some basis about deep learning algorithms.
